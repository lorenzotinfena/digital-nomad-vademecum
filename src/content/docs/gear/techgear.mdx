## Phone

**Quantity**: 1

Considering that we need at least gym headphones and normal headphones:

I think wired headphones are better than the wireless ones.

We have 2 options: jack or USB-C headphones

If we want to chose with USB-C, there are 2 possible types of USB-C audio connections: digital or analogic.

Digital USB-C audio requires an external DAC either in an adapter either integrated in the headphones (because in the analogic USB-C audio the DAC is integrated in the phone), but this takes weight and space.

So for gym headphones is better to use analogic USB-C audio, which requires the phone to have a DAC.

But we have some problem: If we want to use non-gym headphones with USB-C there can be cases where is better to connect the headphones to the thunderbolt dock, and I think thunderbolt docks with a DAC integrated USB-C are rare,

so we would a need an external DAC or DAC integrated headphones.

But there is a also a big problem with USB-C: It cannot be rotated as jack, and this feature along with a 90 degrees jack is really convenient.

And another advantage of jack is that we will not need a USB-C adapter.

All this makes me choose jack 3.5 TRRS over USB-C digital/analog


**Must-have requirements**: 1 USB-C connector, 1 jack 3.5 TRRS, a good bluetooth version, nfc, fingerprint sensor.

**Nice-to-have requirements**: e-sim support, waterproof, oled display

<TabItem label="I want a 2-in-1 laptop">
## Laptop + charger + cables for charging

**Quantity**: 1

2-in-1 laptops are either convertible either detachable, convertible ones I think are handier. 

Note that it would be better to have a laptop with thunderbolt 5 (240w) and thunderbolt 5 docks with power supply, but is too early for this.

I assume that vr headset replace displays other than the main one of the laptop ( the main display of the laptop still have some benefits).

The thunderbolt 4 port is for the vr headset/external display.

The USB C port is for the USB C hub.

If your hub doesn't have enough USB-C ports you can consider using adapters.

**Must-have requirements**: Bluetooth 5, Convertible, 1 port Jack 3.5 TRRS, 1 thunderbolt 4 port, 1 USB-C port (another one), built in microphone, built in webcam.

Do you want connect an external processing unit (for example GPU)

## charger

**Quantity**: 2

1 can be enough, but there are cases when you want to charge your phone on the night table while you want charge your laptop and other devices on another table.
Even dough the we could differ the requirements of the 2 chargers, due to market supply and simplicity I will make the requirements in common.

The universal output plug is useful when for example you only have 1 plug and you want to connect a local lamp.

You will connect the charger of the laptop directly to one of these chargers.

**Must-have requirements**": gan, universal input plug, universal output plug, 2 usb c ports.

**Nice-to-have requirements**: High wattage.
