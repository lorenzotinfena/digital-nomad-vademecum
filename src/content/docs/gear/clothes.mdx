## Workout t-shirt

A fine micron count is important to avoid itch.
Merino wool seems the best material for this purpose, even though is not much durable.
Sleeveless is more breathable.
A dropped armhole t-shirt is more breathable but is bad in windy environments, this makes me choose to avoid dropped armhole.

**Must-have requirements**: Sleeveless, 100% merino wool, light weight at most 200g, flatlock seams, fine micron count, without dropped armhole
