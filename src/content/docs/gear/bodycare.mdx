## Sunscreen

**Quantity**: 1

UV rays are emitted by sunlight and are carcinogenic for humans, UV rays are divided in 3 types: UVA, UVB and UVB.
UVC rays don't reach the earth surface because they are blocked by the ozone layer, but UVA and UVB do and we can use sunscreen to protect us from them.
But sunscreens also lowers some benefits,
for example the vitamin D,
but it seems that even applying a sunscreen regularly, you get enough benefits.

Remember that around 80% of UVA and UVB rays penetrate thorugh clouds, rain and fog.

So you should often apply sunscreen on the parts of your body that are exposed for a medium or long period to sunlight (also indirectly from clouds, rain or fog) or more generically to UVA and UVB rays.

But remember to not be obsessed with it, otherwise you won't get enough benefits from sunlight or more generically from UVA and UVB rays.
And I think you should protect with sunscreen more the parts of your body that are usually covered by clothes.

There are 2 types of sunscreens: mineral or chemical.

Chemical ones penetrate the skin and can damage it, mineral ones stay on the surface.
Chemical ones have higher water resistance.

All this makes me prefer a tinted mineral sunscreen.

Since chemical ones does not leave a cast when spread, and normally mineral ones do,
is better to buy a sunscreen tinted most similar to our skin color (there is a better option, but I will discuss it later).

When looking for a mineral sunscreen remember that all mineral sunscreens are broad-spectrum.

I prefer lotion form (and not spray) to avoid ingestion of the sunscreen.

**Must-have requirements**: 100% Mineral, SPF 30 or higher, lotion form (and not spray)

I the 2 best main active ingredients are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.
A newer ingredient that seems to leave less cast is the iron oxide, but I think is too new to be used.

I prefer to not include integrators here because I think a good diet is enough.

**Nice-to-have requirements**: titanium dioxide and zinc oxide as main active ingredients, SPF 50 or higher, tinted most similar to your skin color, high water resistance

To reduce even more the cast you can opt for smaller particles of zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, but not too much small, otherwise it can be less protective.


**Nicer-to-have requirements**: Small particles of zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide (usually commercially labeled as "transparent")
