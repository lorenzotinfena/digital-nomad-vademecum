## Hot temperature workout/casual t-shirt

**Quantity**: 1

This will also be used in colder environments under other clothes

Merino wool seems the best material for this purpose, even though is not much durable.
Sleeveless is more breathable, but is bad in windy environments, this makes me choose a short sleeve.

**Must-have requirements**: 100% merino wool, short sleeve

A white color heats up less in sunlight.
A fine micron count is important to avoid itch.

**Nice-to-have requirements**: white color, light weight at most 200g, flatlock seams, fine micron count, without logo
