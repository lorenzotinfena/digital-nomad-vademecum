## Hot temperature workout/casual t-shirt

**Quantity**: 1

This will also be used in colder environments under other clothes

Merino wool seems the best material for this purpose, even though is not much durable.
Sleeveless is more breathable, but is bad in windy environments, this makes me choose a short sleeve.

**Must-have requirements**: 100% merino wool, short sleeve

A white color heats up less in sunlight.
A fine micron count is important to avoid itch.

**Nice-to-have requirements**: white color, light weight at most 200g, flatlock seams, fine micron count, without logo

## Underwear trunks

**Quantity**: 2

**Must-have requirements**: 100% merino wool, dark color

**Nice-to-have requirements**: light weight, flatlock seams, fine micron count, without logo

## Jammers

**Quantity**: 1

This is for swimming, and if you want you can wear it underneath a pair of swim suitable shorts

This will also be used as everyday underwear trunks backup and as hot weather shorts.

### Why avoid swim trunks

Usually swim trunks have a liner, there are 2 types of liners: compression liner and mesh liner.

I think compression liner makes the swim trunks more versatile for everyday use, but I think we can do this more modular splitting the outer layer with the liner,
this section covers the "liner" part and in another section you will find the light shorts

### Fabric

Merino wool is weak when wet and is less chlorine resistant.

The best fabric for swimwear is pbt, and the second best is LYCRA® XTRA LIFE ™ because is less breathable and has more moisture wicking than pbt.

The third best fabric is spandex, which is similar to LYCRA® XTRA LIFE ™ but less durable.

The problem with all these materials is the durability, and for this reason usually they are blended
with polyester.

**Must-have requirements**:
<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Best">Around 50% polyester and 50% pbt</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Second best">Around 80% polyester and 20% LYCRA® XTRA LIFE ™</TabItem>
