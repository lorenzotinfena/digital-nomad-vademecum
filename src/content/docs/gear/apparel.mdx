## Hot temperature workout/casual t-shirt

**Quantity**: 1

This will also be used in colder environments under other clothes

Merino wool seems the best material for this purpose, even though is not much durable.
Sleeveless is more breathable, but is bad in windy environments, this makes me choose a short sleeve.

**Must-have requirements**: 100% merino wool, short sleeve

A white color heats up less in sunlight.
A fine micron count is important to avoid itch.

**Nice-to-have requirements**: white color, light weight at most 200g, flatlock seams, fine micron count, without logo

## Underwear trunks

## Swim trunks / everyday shorts

**Quantity**: 1

The best fabrics are spandex and polyester. Spandex is for comfort and polyester for durability. A blend with 90% polyester and 10% spandex is the best choice.

There are 2 types of liners: compression liner and mesh liner, I think compression liner makes the swim trunks more versatile for everyday use.

**Must-have requirements**: Around 90% polyester and 10% spandex, compression liner, laces, 1 zipped pocket

**Nice-to-have requirements**: Fine fiber.
