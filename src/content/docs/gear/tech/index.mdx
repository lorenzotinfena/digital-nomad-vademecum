## Phone

Considering that we need at least gym headphones and normal headphones:

I think wired headphones are better than the wireless ones.

We have 2 options: jack or USB-C headphones

If we want to chose with USB-C, there are 2 possible types of USB-C audio connections: digital or analogic.

Digital USB-C audio requires an external DAC either in an adapter either integrated in the headphones (because in the analogic USB-C audio the DAC is integrated in the phone), but this takes weight and space.

So for gym headphones is better to use analogic USB-C audio, which requires the phone to have a DAC.

But we have some problem: If we want to use non-gym headphones with USB-C there can be cases where is better to connect the headphones to the thunderbolt dock, and I think thunderbolt docks with a DAC integrated USB-C are rare,

so we would a need an external DAC or DAC integrated headphones.

But there is a also a big problem with USB-C: It cannot be rotated as jack, and this feature along with a 90 degrees jack is really convenient.

And another advantage of jack is that we will not need a USB-C adapter.

All this makes me choose jack 3.5 TRRS over USB-C digital/analog


**Requirements**: 1 USB-C connector, 1 jack 3.5 TRRS, a good bluetooth version, nfc, fingerprint sensor.

**Optional requirements**: e-sim support, waterproof

## Laptop

Note that this doesn't include the charger.

I assume that vr headset replace monitors other than the main one of the laptop (it still have some benefits).
There are 2 main setup when using the laptop:
- In charge: It is connected with a thunderbolt dock and every peripheral is attached to the dock.
- On battery: The only peripheral you can attach are headphones (jack), phone (usb-c), mouse (usb-c) and vr headset (thunderbolt), if you need to connect more peripherals consider using the first approach.

**Requirements**: Bluetooth 5, Convertible, 1 port Jack 3.5 TRRS, 1 thunderbolt 4/5 port, 2 USB-C port (another one), built in microphone, built in webcam.

In the optional requirements I added a USB-C if you want connect also a flash drive.

**Optional requirements**: Dynamic amoled screen, active stylus, fingerprint reader, 1 USB-C port (another one).

## Thunderbolt 4/5 dock

The thunderbolt ports are for the host and the vr headset, the 5 USB-C are for the phone, a flash drive, mouse, keyboard and powerbank/electric shaver, the ethernet and the jack are self-explanatory, the only USB-A port is still always useful

**Requirements**: 2 thunderbolt 4/5 port (including the host port), 1 displayport, 1 Ethernet, 1 3.5mm TRRS jack, 1 USB type A standard port, 5 USB-C ports.

Here I added 2 USB-C if you want to connect microphone or a webcam. If your dock doesn't have enough USB-C ports you can consider using adapters.

**Optional requirements**: Micro sd reader, 2 USB-C
