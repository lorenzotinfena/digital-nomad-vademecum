General considerations:

- **Headphones connector and phone**

  Considering that we need at least gym headphones and normal headphones:

  I think wired headphones are better than the wireless ones.

  We have 2 options: jack or USB-C headphones

  If we want to chose with USB-C, there are 2 possible types of USB-C audio connections: digital or analogic.

  Digital USB-C audio requires an external DAC either in an adapter either integrated in the headphones (because in the analogic USB-C audio the DAC is integrated in the phone), but this takes weight and space.

  So for gym headphones is better to use analogic USB-C audio, which requires the phone to have a DAC.

  But we have some problem: If we want to use non-gym headphones with USB-C there can be cases where is better to connect the headphones to the thunderbolt dock, and I think thunderbolt docks with a DAC integrated USB-C are rare,

  so we would a need an external DAC or DAC integrated headphones.

  But there is a also a big problem with USB-C: It cannot be rotated as jack, and this feature along with a 90 degrees jack is really convenient.

  And another advantage of jack is that we will not need a USB-C adapter.

  All this makes me choose jack 3.5 TRRS over USB-C digital/analog

# Possessions:
## Phone

Requirements: 1 USB-C connector, 1 jack 3.5 TRRS, a good bluetooth version, nfc, fingerprint sensor.

Optional requirements: e-sim support

## Headphones
### Gym headphones

Considerations: I think air conduction is safer than bone conduction.

Requirements: Open ear, air conduction, wired with jack 3.5 TRRS, built in microphone.
